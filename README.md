# Frontend Test

**â€‹Your task is to create a user interface for lovers of the Star Wars movie franchise.**

_You should use the People endpoint from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/) for your data._

## Acceptance Criteria: ##

##### The application should: #####

- [ ] Fetch and display a list of characters
- [ ] Contain a "next" and "previous" button which when clicked will fetch the next and previous page of results respectively (the endpoint you use already supports pagination)
- [ ] When the application displays the first page of results, the previous button should be disabled
- [ ] When the application displays the last page of results, the next button should be disabled
- [ ] The current page number should be visible
- [ ] Contain a button to sort results on the current page by "mass"

```
Optional:
- [ ] Build the application so that a user can access the page number through a parameter on the url: e.g. <domain>/14 would load the application with page 14 (if it exists)
Please complete the task using React and/or NextJS
